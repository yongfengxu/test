Introduction
------------

ESC ("Ericsson StateChart") is a language for specifying state
machines (a.k.a. statecharts), as well as a suite of tools for working
with them.

ESC statecharts are written in *.esc files. The following tools and
frameworks are provided:

escgen.py     a code generator that parses an .esc file and generates
              C++ code that implements the behaviour of the statechart

esc2image.py  a diagram generator that parses an .esc file and
              generates one or more diagrams for the statechart

EscEditor     an Eclipse plugin that integrates everything and
              provides functionality such as jumping between the code
              in the .esc file, the diagram view and the generated
              C++ code

esc-mode.el   an Emacs library providing an ESC major mode as well as
              support for rendering the state machine in an Emacs
              buffer

libesc        A C++ support library that is used by the generated C++
              code and hooks it into the EPG code

The documentation is divided into these parts:

esc_language_reference.txt
- A reference of all the syntax and keywords of the ESC language.

cpp_esc_integration.txt
- Information about integration of ESC code and C++ code
